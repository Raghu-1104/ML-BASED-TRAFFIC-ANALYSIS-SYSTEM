# ML-Based Traffic Analysis System.  

This project is an intelligent traffic analysis system powered by machine learning to optimize and manage traffic flow effectively. The system leverages real-time data from cameras and sensors to detect, classify, and analyze vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic patterns.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Object Detection**: Identifies vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals in real-time using ML models.  
- **Traffic Flow Analysis**: Analyzes traffic density and patterns to detect congestion and optimize signal timings.  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual traffic conditions or violations for further action.  
- **Data Visualization**: Presents actionable insights through dashboards for better decision-making.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- Machine Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch)  
- Computer Vision (OpenCV)  
- Data Visualization Tools  
- APIs for real-time traffic data integration  

This system provides a scalable and efficient solution for traffic management, helping reduce congestion and enhance urban mobility.
